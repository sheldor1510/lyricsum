## What is Lyricsum?
Lyricsum is a new way to generate placeholder text. It's a website that takes the lyrics of your favorite artists' songs and converts them into placeholder text which can be further customized using the format options available.

Check it out at <a href="https://lyricsum.com" target="_blank">lyricsum.com</a>.

## Why?
Being bored of looking at the same lorem ipsum all the time, we wanted to add some variety, so, being melophiles, we decided on songs as the alternative.

## Features
